# Automatic feature engineering using deep learning and Bayesian inference

We will explore the use of autoencoders for automatic feature engineering. The idea is to automatically learn a set of features from, potentially noisy, raw data that can be useful in supervised learning tasks such as in computer vision and insurance using synthetic financial transactions data.
